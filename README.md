# Eco-enzyme Quality Monitoring System
An Internet of Things (IoT) based monitoring platform designed to track and analyze the quality of eco-enzyme liquid in real time. The system collects multiple environmental parameters through sensors installed inside an eco-enzyme box, stores the data in a cloud database, and visualizes it through a responsive web dashboard.

# ✨ Features
- Real-time sensor data collection
- Web-based dashboard for data visualization
- Automatic notifications for condition changes
- Historical data tracking
- Scalable and maintainable architecture

# 📡 Monitored Parameters
- Temperature (°C)
- Humidity (%)
- Gas concentration (CO)
- Water turbidity 
- pH level
- Salt content (ppm)

# 🎯 Objectives / Goals
- Design and develop an Internet of Things (IoT) device capable of capturing and processing sensor measurements from an eco-enzyme box and sending the data to a website.
- Develop a web application that displays real-time sensor values and presents processed data results from the eco-enzyme monitoring system.

# 🚀 Benefits
- This web-based application is expected to help users monitor sensor data from eco-enzyme containers easily and efficiently. It can serve as a reference for future development of similar solutions. The application assists users in monitoring key environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, gas levels, pH, water turbidity, and salt content, which contribute to determining the eco-enzyme liquid’s readiness.

# 🧠 How It Works
- IoT sensors measure environmental conditions inside the eco-enzyme container.
- Sensor data is transmitted to a cloud database.
- The web dashboard retrieves and visualizes real-time values.
- Users receive status insights and condition-based notifications.
