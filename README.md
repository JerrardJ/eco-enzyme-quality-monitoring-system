# eco-enzyme-quality-monitoring-system
This project uses IoT devices to collect measurement values from an eco-enzyme box. Data is sent to a database and shown through a website dashboard. The system monitors temperature, humidity, gas levels, turbidity, pH, and salt content. The website can notify users about the eco-enzyme condition and indicate whether the liquid is ready for use.
